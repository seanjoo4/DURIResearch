<p>Project: Protecting Internet Users with Epilepsy or Chronic Migraine from Graphic Based Attacks</p>
<p>Mentor: Professor Rua William</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>For those with epilepsy or chronic migraine, browsing online can be dangerous as graphic-based images such as GIFs can pose threats such as seizures. Thus, to prevent this, throughout the semester, I parsed GIFs into frames and compare consecutive frames in pairs. When analyzing these frames, using Java, I analyzed three factors: the ratio of average intensity, percentage of dangerous pixels, and hertz value. Ultimately every GIF was assigned three threat levels, risky, dangerous, and extreme, if one, two, or three conditions were satisfied, respectively.
